		<description><![CDATA[OpenDNS does have a SSL encrypted DNS service, which should solve the problem, but I would suggest that there should be a deeper concern -- which is that HTTP proxies will likely be tampered or surveilled, and, even if your proxy connection is secured with a legitimate SSL setup, it is still likely to be throttled. If you have a host for a proxy server, then you should be able to personally run something at least marginally better, if not a Tor bridge, then an OpenVPN service or SSH SOCKS proxy, perhaps?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I came across your website through some Googling today.  My girlfriend is in Iran right now and I&#039;m trying to get her set up with a way to get around the filter.  

I had her using my proxy server and Google&#039;s public DNS, but I came across the same thing you did: DNS requests to blocked websites were still somehow getting interfered with.  They&#039;re returning that same IP that you show above: 10.10.34.34. 

So, now I see that it&#039;s tampering of the request itself.  Now I&#039;m brainstorming how to get around this (without buying VPN anyway)... 

I don&#039;t know of any public DNS server that allows secure DNS requests.  I suppose I could send her a squid cache of many popular domains, but I don&#039;t know if she could handle setting up squid.  Hmmmmm... any ideas?]]></description>

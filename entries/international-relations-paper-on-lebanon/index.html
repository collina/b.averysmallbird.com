<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>A fundamental tenet of the Bush doctrine is the commitment and promotion of “extending democracy, legitimacy, and security to all regions.”</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> No region, other than the continent of Africa, seems more in need of such a promise than that of the Middle East. In line with the theories of the doctrine, it would be elementary to state that the promotion of a stable and sovereign territory of Lebanon would aid in the security and economic development of the region and the world as a whole. A shift towards the image of being a neutral interloper, and not the enabler of Israel in Lebanon would go far to legitimize American foreign policy. Moreover, the United States’ historically close ties to the both states provide it with a unique position of influence to fulfill the Bush mandate through the use of soft power, namely diplomacy and economic incentives. Absent a shift in U.S. position, Lebanon’s long history of instability and conflict alludes to a tragic repeat of past events with the same common and rarely fluctuating cast of characters. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal Times New Roman"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Conflict Background</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>A complete history of the events of Lebanon from the civil war to current would be a lengthy and confusing volume. This is because the disintegration of order in Beirut and the countryside did not lead to the general polarized conflict between a domestic insurgency and a weak government. The break up of the conciliatory democracy in 1975 instead lead to a power struggle between a large number of ethnic groups. Lebanon is by geographic mandate a country politically fractured demographically.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> While much of the break up was a result of the empowerment of the minority Maronite Christian community by France, conflict in Lebanon has arisen not out of political repression by this minorities, but the inability of the state to adequately keep up with the shifting changes in population and political culture. As the Muslim communities outgrew Christians demands for the reapportionment of government posts became more intense and divided the country. </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>Internal conflict lead to a power vacuum of regional forces. Beirut, the capital city, was quickly sectioned off and patrolled by the militias of Maronite, Shi’a, Druze and Sunni Muslim religious parties. Numerous state actors intervened Syria and Israel first. After which, western forces and Iranian established themselves with the declared intent of promoting stability. Non-state actors with foreign backing such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Amal and Hizballah took advantage of this void as well.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The Israeli incursion into Lebanon in summer of 2006 adequately frame the roles of domestic and foreign entities throughout the past three decades. The most recent escalation of violence began with the July 12th ambush by Hizballah forces on an IDF patrol of the border and rocket attacks on a Israeli border towns. As in previous instances, Hizballah captured Israeli soldiers in order to secure an exchange of Lebanese prisoners. Israel retaliated to the incident with a systemic naval and air blockade along with massive strikes on targets within southern Lebanon. Ambushes by Hizb’allah are not uncommon, one such raid resulting in a prisoner swap exchanging four IDF troops for five hundred alleged guerillas. Furthermore, rocket attacks on Israeli are not new, however, the United Nations has observed that not one of these attacks has resulted in an Israeli citizen causality. Often these rockets were not from Hizballah, but from Palestinian militants concerned with Palestinian politics entrenched within Lebanon territory. This is likely the result of the unsophisticated manner of Hizballah targeting technology and not intent.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>It is clear that Israel is not the only antagonist remaining in Lebanon. Since Israel’s withdrawal from the southern border and the dismantling of the Southern Lebanon Army, Syria has been the greatest foreign presence in the country. Syria has been directly implicated by international investigations in the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the anti-Syrian prime minister. This lead to the infamous ‘Cedar Revolution’, a series of anti-Syrian protests and political alliances which led to the abandonments of direct intervention by Syrian in domestic affairs. This did not lead to a complete end of Syrian indirect meddling. During the August incursion, Syria, by way of being Iran’s proxy, was accused with furnishing Hizb’allah with advanced arms used in the indiscriminate, long range shelling of Israeli towns like Haifa. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal Times New Roman"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Current status of the mission</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) has struggled against these state and non-state aggressors for the past thirty years in a stated effort to restore security and sovereignty to the state of Lebanon. While the mission was started as a truce monitoring and peace keeping mission, it has expanded to become a reconstruction effort when hostilities flair. Currently, the United Nations details the operation in Lebanon militarily as observation from static positions, intensive patrolling, investigation, reporting and observation of developments on the ground. Non-military services include helping refuges return to villages, removing unexploded Israeli cluster bombs from the summer conflict, continuing prior de-mining work, field hospital services, and veterinary services for the farming community.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>UNSCR 425 was issued on March 19, 1978, five days after the incursion of Israeli troops into Lebanon as a result of Palestinian Liberation Organization attacks on Israeli civilians. At this point Lebanon had already been in the midst of a three year old civil war which split the country along sectarian lines and diminished the effectiveness of the central government. The resolution called for the withdrawal of Israel from the country and the establishment of UNIFIL to validate Israel was out of the country. While Israel followed the general principle of UNSC 425 and withdrew IDF troops from most of Lebanon, it ignored UNIFIL and set up a domestic military proxy called the South Lebanon Army to control a ‘security zone’ along its border. The seventies would not be the only instance of Israeli intervention in Lebanon. The summer of 1982 found Israeli Defense Forces trading artillery exchanges with PLO factions in the capital city while UNIFIL sat on the sidelines helpless.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>In September of 2004, France and the United States sponsored a Security Council Resolution which aimed at the withdrawal of foreign influence and the dismantling of domestic militias in Lebanon. UNSC 1559 reflected the language of the Taef Accords, which settled the Civil War and demanded autonomy from foreign influence, but only gained weight as an international mandate for the aims of Hariri’s Cedar Revolution.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>After the latest incursion by the Israeli Defense Forces, UNSC resolution 1701 increased the troops commitment of UNIFIL from 2 000 to around 15 000. These forces come from a wide range of countries, the largest contributors being China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Nepal, Poland and Spain. Much of the force is actively engaged with the reconstruction effort, de-mining and arms control. As the quantity of the peacekeepers expanded, so did the rules of engagement. This new authority allows the use of force against “hostile activity of any kind, whether in self-defence, to ensure their area of operation is not used for hostile activities or to resist attempts by force to prevent them from discharging their duties”</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>For the most part Hizballah has lent rhetorical support to the U.N. enforcement of 1701 and immediately promised to not get in the way of U.N. forces. Despite this, the organization has been seen setting up camps just beyond the U.N. reach. UNIFIL, while not having a mandate from the Lebanese government to disarm militias, has confiscated several shipments and stashes of arms maintained by Hizballah.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The history of Israel’s incursions into Lebanon lay clear expectations for any further Israeli actions. When the UNIFIL forces were unable to carry out its mission as a result of air or ground strikes along the Blue Line, “…hezbollah maintained its visible presence near the line through its network of mobile and fixed positions, also continuing to extend social, medical and educational services to the local population in areas near the Blue Line”. Unfortunately, the role of UNIFIL is by mandate limited. “It is up to the Lebanese authorities, to the Lebanese army, to find a solution, to make Hezbollah give back its weapons. “ Israeli skepticism toward the mission also puts it in a weaker position with demands that UNIFIL dismantle Hizballah. Israel’s treatment of UNIFIL rhetorically and during strikes has but the country in a unfavorable opinion with UNIFIL forces. As a former spokesperson for UNIFIL stated, “<em>there is no enemy in a peacekeeping force. UNIFIL is a peacekeeping force. It’s not an Israeli combat force or an anti-terror force, as they would like it to be. As long as we don’t serve their direct interests, they are going to denigrate it as much as they can.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal Times New Roman"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Present U.S. Role</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The United States is no stranger to intervening in the affairs of Lebanon. During the Lebanese civil war, the United States deployed four marine units through a Multination Force to oversee the withdrawal of entrenched PLO troops. This force consisted of 2000 troops from the US, France and Italy, 800 being American Marines. After the successful withdrawal of the Palestinian fighters, the mission shifted to quell domestic unrest and expedite the withdrawal of the Israeli army that occupied the country as deeply as into the capital city. Generally the mission was seen as a success internationally until the MNF became a target of resistance groups, first with the bombing of the American embassy in Beirut and then with the deadly bombing of a marine barracks that kill 241 American soldiers. With the pressure of Congress, the Reagan administration decided that the area was too unsafe for American interests and pulled out, with the rest of the MNF following shortly thereafter. The horror of this event still resonates in U.S. policy and is a large obstacle to any direct troop placement back into Lebanon. Popular thought in the U.N. is that American soldiers would make the intentionally diversified force a target for anti-American violence.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>For the first time since the pull out, the administration of George W. Bush has taken an extraordinary interest diplomatically and financially in the events within Lebanon. For the administration, the events are a integral part of an ongoing campaign of strengthening pro-Western alliances and governments. Keen to avoid the mistakes of Iraq, the administration relied heavily on its foreign allies and the United Nations to pressure Syria out of the region and curb Hizballah influence. The most immediate reaction to the summer events was to back the empowerment of the UNIFIL mission as a stepping stone to a long term goal of strengthening a legitimate national army. The Bush administration’s involvement with the United Nations is only one outlet on a multi-pronged approach in the settling of the most recent conflict.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>Bush’s declaration that <em>“one vulnerability is that many of the new democratic governments in the region have not yet established effective control over all their territory</em>”</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> also is an insight into the manner that the administration has proceeded in resolving the conflict in Lebanon. Through large financial contributions and the diplomatic backing of the existing government, America has sought to bring a greater legitimacy to political actors that are fully in line with the non-violent, political process. This money has been directed two way, the empowerment of anti-Hizballah parties, mostly Sunni groups, and reconstruction aid to areas targeted by Israel. News reports have indicated a massive CIA effort towards backing the pro-West, anti-Syrian government of Fouad Siniora and diminishing the influence of Hizballah. This effort includes the funding of militias that support the current regime. America has also invested hope in the use of funds for rebuilding as a method of building support for the current government and eroding the source of much of Hizballah’s good will in the south.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal Times New Roman"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">U.S. Interests</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The destruction of the sovereignty of Lebanon and the diminishment of the government’s power is a result is one of the worst cases of diplomatic neglect in recent years. A strong and stable Lebanon will lend to the formation of a stable Middle East with respect for Western liberalism. In recent years, especially after the Cedar Revolution, the hope of the international community has been the demilitarization of Hizb’allah and its integration into Lebanese politics. Such efforts have been fairly successful with the integration of the Amal group which holds fourteen seats in the 128 seat parliament and hold the speaker position. Amal militants have also integrated into the Lebanese army. It is important to emphasize the danger of re-entanglement in the vacuum of power after the weakening of the Siniora government. Beyond the promise of a stable government congruent with the wishes of the Bush doctrine, there are three other principles at work in the American intervention in Lebanon. </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>Lebanon is also a significant piece in the larger sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shi’a Islam. In opposition to the Israel, there is a triangular alliance in the region between the Shi’a influences of Hizballah and Iran with the political backing of the Sunni state of Syria. On the other hand countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt promote policy favorable to Western influence, despite domestic policy repugnant to Western liberalism. This rift is made more dangerous by the instability on Iraq, where the sectarian conflict has actually turn from diplomatic rhetoric to unfettered violence. This promotion of friendly allies can be seen when the administration attempts to promote the idea of ‘mainstream arab states’ like Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in contrast to troublemakers like Syria and Iran.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> Domestically, this is sectarian complication is compounded by an odd and shifting set of domestic alliances, the latest being the involvement on the once fervently anti-Syrian Maronite militia General Michel Aoun with the pro-Syrian Hizballah political figures in an effort to topple the government for a run at the presidency.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The mission of stabilizing Lebanon is purely justifiable within the scope of national security. The undeterred build up of Hizballah has created yet another entity with both the tactical means and motivation to commit acts of political terrorism within the United States. While Iran plays an oppositional role in a larger, esoteric sectarian crisis, it has its own role in the more immediate term with its current involvement in the development of nuclear technology and funding of insurgency groups in Iraq. Hizballah has been labeled at every opportunity a creature of Iran, who was responsible for its creation, training and funding.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> After the dust settled in the summer engagement, Iran began to funnel reconstruction money into Lebanon through Hizballah front groups like Jihad al-Bina.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> It also continued to arm the party with increasing sophisticated technology that was able to strike deeper into Israel.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>One last draw of the United States into Lebanon, is the relationship between Lebanon and its creator, France. France has throughout Lebanese history been involved with peacekeeping forces in Lebanon from the beginning of the civil war to its current deployment of 3000 soldiers in the region. Perhaps out of colonial bonds, France has lead many of the attempts at international cooperation in resolving the dispute. The list of Security Council resolutions in which France was an author is rather large and includes UNSC resolutions 425, 426, 1559 and 1701.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: center; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal Times New Roman"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">Future Considerations</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The United States has always been heavily been involved in the latest events, even to the point of being accused of being the cause. The difference between this past summer and recent developments is the shift towards having a more visible concern for domestic Lebanese politics and the rebuilding effort. The U.S. appears to have realized that counter-terrorism activities are not the proper resolution to the empowerment of Hizballah, instead administration has turned to legitimizing the existing government and putting distance between Israel and Hizballah. </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>For now, the idea of disarming Hizballah seems entirely unlikely. This would require convincing the Lebanese government of the necessity to do so as the UNIFIL forces are deployed at the wishes of the Lebanese government. The biggest impediment to this effort is the high degree of representation that the party has within the parliament and the prime minister’s cabinet. If the U.S. feels that it is in the best interest of Lebanon to focus on the disarming of Hizballah, then it should do so through the UNIFIL forces’ mandate of keeping the Blue Line free from arms. This would reduce or delay the threat of another provocation of Israel, which would only push more of southern Lebanon into a closer relationship with Hizballah.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The United States should condemn the actions of both parties which mutually escalated the events of the previous summer and assert the principle that the violation of basic international codes of conduit will be enforced on both sides. It must also continue to emphasize that Hizballah, and its leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, must not be allowed to operate with impunity in southern Lebanon. While the latter seems like more of a momental task than the former, the destruction of Hizballah’s air of legitimate will go a long way to marginalizing the influence of the party. The encouragement of Israeli restraint in both Lebanon and the Occupied Territories should be followed up with the reenforcement and legitimization of the Siniora government. The widely held opinion of much of the world is that Hizb’allah was created as a legitimate domestic insurgency against an occupying foreign force. The administration cannot see the process of dismantling Hizballah in such black and white terms as the demand that “…<em>if they want to participate in the political life of their countries, they must disarm…elected leaders cannot have one foot in the camp of democracy and one foot in the camp of terror.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> Instead, the idea should be promoted that a reliance on the democratic process will lead to the voluntary disarming of Hizballah troops. Israeli’s bombing campaign has done nothing more than further the entrenchment of the party in southern Lebanese society through their public reconstruction efforts financed by both Iranian funds and international contracts.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>Many parts of the Siniora Plan for the resolution of the summer conflict should be included in further diplomacy. These demands include the release of Lebanese prisoners in Israel, the extension of the power of UNIFIL and the release of the Shebaa Farms area. The desire of Hizballah to release prisoners has been an ongoing source of conflict. Raids for prisoner exchange is a common occurs and directly caused the summer conflict. Shortly before the raid Hizballah had declared that 2006 would be “the year of retrieving the prisoners”</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px">.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>While the Security Council ruled that the May 2000 withdrawal of Israel was consistent with UN demands, part of the land controlled by Israel remains a point of contention. The international community should reconsider the claim that Hizballah invented the issue of the Shebaa Farms region, a disputed plot of land retained by Israel after its initial invasion of Lebanon. The unresolved nature of the territory threatens to renew conflict between Lebanon and Syria in the event that Israel relinquishes control of the area. Following the Siniora Plan, the area should be placed under UN jurisdiction until the issue of ownership has been adjudicated by an international legal process. Much of this can be accomplished by the abandonment of a side deal in switch “the United States pledged to use its veto power in the Security Council to block any decision by Annan to hand the territory directly over to Lebanon.”</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The United States can directly contribute to the enforcement of humanitarian conventions by halting the sale and discourage the use of cluster bombs by Israel. These cluster bombs have been used without the necessary precautions in civil areas and remain hazardous when unexploded shells deteriorate. Human Rights Watch has condemned Israel’s prosecution of their war effort as ‘systematic failure by the IDF to distinguish between combatants and civilians’</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"> in their use of such munitions.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>The United States along with France have also rightful backed the establishment of a tribunal patterned on previous prosecuting panels in the case of the assassination of Rafik Hariri.  The Siniora government has backed the creation of the tribunal, but the idea has met with opposition from the pro-Syrian speaker of the parliament. If the issue cannot be resolved within the constitutional framework of Lebanon and it continues to do the political damage that it has so far, the issue should be referred to the UNSC.</span></p>

<p style="font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Times New Roman; margin: 0px"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">	</span>It is crucial in this environment to interfere with the socioeconomic stagnation which produces disaffected communities. The pinnacle events of September 11th, the bombing Tanzania and Kenya embassies and the sectarian clashes in Iraq bring a new proposition to public relevance of foreign policy. It is obvious now that the collapse of a state has more impact than just the increase of displaced refugees and breakdowns in social, political and economic internal order. Failing states uniquely foster new levels of social fanaticism. The political void left by the Russian withdrawal in Afghanistan after the extended insurgency of the mujahidden enabled the formation of the Taliban. In Somalia, the collapse of a dictatorship and the failure of a secular, transitional government to meaningfully consolidate its power led the formation of the radical social movement towards strict Islamic law. Hizballah supplanting the democratic government of Lebanon can only exacerbate preexisting tensions among sectarian groups in the region. King Abdullah of Jordan has warned that Lebanon risks being the third region in the Middle East to collapse into civil war.</span></p>

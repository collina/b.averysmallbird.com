				<h1>Splunk IPO Statement on Export Regulations Compliance</h1>
				<p>From Page 18 of Splunk Inc.’s <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000104746912000155/a2206835zs-1.htm#ca74101_prospectus_summary">SEC Form S-1</a>, dated 12 January 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.</strong></p>
<p>Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption registration. We shipped our encryption products prior to obtaining the required export authorizations. Accordingly, we have not fully complied with applicable encryption controls in the Export Administration Regulations. We are in the process of remediating our export compliance procedures to prevent such violations from recurring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are taking precautions to prevent our products and services from being shipped to U.S. sanctions targets, we believe that certain of our products that are available at no cost have been downloaded by persons in countries that are the subject of U.S. embargoes. These free downloads were likely made in violation of U.S. export control and sanctions laws. Based upon our inquiry to date, we believe that we have not had any paying customers in countries sanctioned by the U.S. Government, and have instituted procedures, including IP blocking, that are intended to prevent any downloads from being made into sanctioned countries in the future. In addition, we had not been screening our customers against the U.S. Government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons. Based upon our inquiry to date, we believe that we do not have any paying customers on any U.S. Government lists of prohibited persons. We are in the process of screening our non-paying customers to determine if we have permitted any free downloads to any prohibited persons. We are also instituting a process for screening all paying and non-paying customers against U.S. Government lists of prohibited persons going forward.</p>
<p>We are continuing to review this matter and new or different facts may be discovered in the course of our inquiry. In January 2012, we filed Initial Notifications of Voluntary Self Disclosures with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control concerning these potential violations. Once we complete our review, we will supplement the Initial Notifications by filing Final Disclosures with both agencies. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in fines or penalties for us and for individuals, including civil penalties of up to $250,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per violation, and in the event of conviction for a criminal violation, fines of up to $1 million and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers for willful and knowing violations. The voluntary disclosure processes with OFAC and BIS are in the initial stages, and we cannot predict when OFAC and BIS will complete their reviews or what enforcement action, if any, they will take.</p>
<p>We also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.</p>
<p>In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p></blockquote>
